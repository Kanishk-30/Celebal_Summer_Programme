# Celebal Summer ML Projects

This repository contains small machine learning projects built during my summer internship at Celebal Technologies.

## Projects

- **Plant Disease Classifier**: Traditional ML approach using handcrafted features and Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Animal Species Detector**: [Coming Soon]

Each folder contains its own dataset references, code, and result visualizations.
